Welcome to <b>TZ Translate</b>!

<b>TZ Translate</b> is a space where I'd like to share with you my thoughts on translation or, more broadly, language Industry. 

As a <b>translator</b> and a <b>language service provider</b> on a larger scope with 10 years of professional experience, I have been working with wonderful clients worldwide.

In the upper right corner of the page, you will find two categories: "Business" and "Tech". In ["Business"](https://tztranslate.com/blog-business/), I will write about <b>professional translation practices</b> and in ["Tech"](https://tztranslate.com/blog-tech/), I will share some thoughts during the scientific research and teaching experiences in universities about <b>Translation Technologies</b> and <b>Translation Automation</b>.

As we well know, reading is an interactive communication between the author and the reader, hence an article becomes valuable when it reaches the public. Therefore, if you find an article in <b> TZ Translate </b> interesting, please leave your comments through the <b> social networks </b> at the bottom of the page. That would make me so happy!

I hope that you find this place interesting!
