Welcome to <b>TZ Translate</b>!

This is a simple web site built with Github and Jekyll. The purpose is to create a space to keep and share interesting ideas coming up every day related to <b>translation</b>. As a matter of fact, I really hate that they would escape from my mind over time.

As a <b>translator</b> and a <b>language service provider</b> with 10 years of professional experience, I have been working with wonderful clients worldwide.

<b>TZ Translate</b> is a space where I'd like to share with you my thoughts on <b>Translation</b> or, more broadly, <b>Language Industry</b>. 

In the upper right corner of the page, you will find two categories: "Business" and "Tech". In ["Business"](https://tztranslate.com/blog-business/), I will write about <b>professional translation practices</b> and in ["Tech"](https://tztranslate.com/blog-tech/), I will share some thoughts during the scientific research and teaching experiences in universities about <b>Translation Technologies</b> and <b>Translation Automation</b>. You can read the articles in [English](https://tztranslate.com/en/business/2020/08/01/welcome-to-tztranslate.html), [Spanish](https://tztranslate.com/es/business/2020/08/01/bienvenido-a-tztranslate.html) or [Chinese](https://tztranslate.com/zh-cn/business/2020/08/01/welcome-to-tztranslate-zh.html)(or in more languages, if you want to collaborate!).

As we well know, reading is an interactive communication between the author and the reader, hence an article becomes valuable when it reaches the public. Therefore, if you find an article in <b> TZ Translate </b> interesting, please leave your comments through the <b> social networks </b> at the bottom of the page. That would make me so happy!

I hope that you find this place interesting!
