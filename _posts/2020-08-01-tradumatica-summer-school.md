Today I woke up feeling very weird because I know that I will not find anyone when I enter Jitsi Meet like every single day for the last three weeks.

On Telegram people are still chatting and sending pics from all corners of the world.

A very strange summer, but a wonderful summer school.

See you soon guys. Online or offline.
